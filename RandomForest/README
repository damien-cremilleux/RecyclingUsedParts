How to train the Decision Tree Ensemble (Random Forest)
--------------------
Use: python trainDT.py train_data.csv

If train_data.csv is in another directory, change the name to match it.

The training can take several minutes, be patient!
Five files will be created: dt1.p, dt10.p, dt100.p, dt200.p. They represent the random forest for each forest size.


How to execute the classification
----------------------------------
Use: python executeMLP.py <forestFile> test_data.csv


Data files
----------
The data files must be in a csv format without empty lines at the end (if there are some empty lines, the training script will crash).
