How to train the MLP
--------------------
Use: python trainMLP.py train_data.csv

The training can take several minutes, be patient!
Five files will be created: MLP_0, MLP_10, MLP_100, MP_1000 and MLP_10000. They are the MLP at a given epoch.


How to execute the classification
----------------------------------
Use: python executeMLP.py MLP_EPOCH test_data.csv


Data files
----------
The data files must be in a csv format, without empty lines at the end (if there are some empty lines, the training script will crash).
